## TEXtile EDGE Sensing: AI Optimization of Edge-based Textile Sensors

This research project aims to improve the usability of
edge-based, textile sensors and to efficiently integrate them into textile
interface designs. Using machine learning and incorporating real user data, an
optimized sensor layout is created, exhibiting high sensitivity in crucial
interaction areas and low sensitivity in less frequently used areas. The haptic
and visual properties of the textile interface are always preserved. The
initial application is intended to be a textile music player. The insights,
tools, and algorithms obtained in this context can be universally applied and
provide designers with the potential to develop optimized textile interfaces
and necessary sensor technology and make precise predictions about their
quality. The goal of the project is to enable textile designs that are tailored
to the user, and that are cost-effective as well as material-conserving. These
designs will demonstrate how user-centric, efficient, and sustainable textile
interfaces can be achieved by integrating edge-based textile sensors through
innovative approaches.

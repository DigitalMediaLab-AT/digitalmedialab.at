# Website for digitalmedialab.at

[Jenkyll Website](https://jekyllrb.com/) for the Digital Media Lab (DML) research group, online at [digitalmedialab.at](digitalmedialab.at). The domain is registered with World4You and hosted on GitHub-Pages. The repository is directly published online by GitHub-Pages. Content is stored file-based: mostly Markdown (.md) and YML (.yml) files.

## Notes on the Setup

`_sass` and `_js` contain the source files. The `css` and `js` folders and their content are only held in this repository to provide them for gh-pages. These tasks arenâ€™t included in the Jekyll build itself, so setting up a development machine is recommended. See the instructions for Windows and Mac OS X below.

# Local Development

If you want to make considerable changes to the website please test them first with a local setup.

These are the complete instructions for a development machine running under Microsoft Windows. The instructions should be very similar for any other operating system and have been verified on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DigitalMediaLab-AT/digitalmedialab.at/blob/main/test_setup_GoogleColab.ipynb) (see [test_setup_GoogleColab](test_setup_GoogleColab.ipynb)).

### Install Git and Clone the Repository

Get the Git binaries from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) or download GitHub Desktop from [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/), then clone the repository to your local machine (e.g., `C:\Users\[User]\Documents\GitHub\digitalmedialab.at`).

### Install Ruby

Go to [http://rubyinstaller.org/](http://rubyinstaller.org/), download the latest installer for Ruby (Ruby+Devkit) and run it.

### Install Bundler and Jekyll

Once Ruby is installed, install Jekyll and its necessary plugins using [Bundler](https://bundler.io/). First, install the Bundler gem: `gem install jekyll bundler`. Then install the gems listed in the Gemfile by calling `bundle install`. For the later command you need have the repo in the current working path.

For further details, see [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

### Start the Build System

The build workflow then uses bundle and can be started with: `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
A local server should be running at the address http://127.0.0.1:4000 and can be used to preview the website. Any changes and additions to markdown files should be imediatly visible. Note that changes to `_config.yml` need a restart of the build system!

## Updating Dependencies

The packages used throughout the site are from the Ruby (gem) and Node.js (npm) ecosystems. They need to be updated separately.

To update all Ruby gems involved, run `bundle update`. To remove (now unused) older versions, type `gem cleanup`.

# Acknowledgements

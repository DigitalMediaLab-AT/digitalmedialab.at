# Innovating Human Interaction through Material-Based Research and Design

In the vibrant world of material-based interaction research, we innovate and create convergences to redefine human interaction with materials. Through extensive textile research and hands-on physical prototyping, we explore the transformative potential of materials in design. Our focus on creating meaningful artefacts and engaging exhibitions reflects our commitment to pushing the boundaries of material exploration. Collaborating closely with material scientists, we delve into the realm of biomaterials, unlocking new possibilities for sustainable and eco-friendly solutions. Our initiatives embrace sustainability as a core principle, driving our collaborations with students and fostering projects that inspire change and progress. Join us on a journey where materials become the canvas for innovation and collaboration knows no bounds.

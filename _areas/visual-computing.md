Emerging at the intersection of computer science, graphics, and human perception, the "Visual Computing" research team in Hagenberg focuses on visual computation in various areas. 

For wildlife ecology applications, we utilize drones and cameratraps and have experience in processing visual data to monitor biodiversity and the ecological impact of humans on our planet. 
We apply recent deep-learning and object detection algorithms including state-of-the-art scene reconstruction such as geometric and radiance field representations and neural representations.

We work on projects involving advanced image editing, synthesis of static and moving picures.  

We have experience in precision motion capture and 3D tracking systems for applications such as animation, virtual reality, robotics, and movement sciences.

Furthermore, we focus on computer graphics efficient real-time-rendering techniques running on mobile, desktop, and the web. 

Whether you're a passionate researcher, student, industry professional, or simply a curious observer, we invite you to join us on this exhilarating journey. Explore with us and create tools and technologies that shape the future of how we interact with the digital world. 

Let's get in touch!

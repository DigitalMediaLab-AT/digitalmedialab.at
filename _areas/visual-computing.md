Join us at the crossroads of computer science, graphics, and human perception—the "Visual Computing" research team in Hagenberg. Our core competencies traverse diverse visual computation fields.

With advanced techniques such as drones and camera traps, we monitor biodiversity and human-induced ecological impacts. We capitalize on deep-learning and object detection algorithms, including sophisticated scene reconstruction methods, for wildlife ecology applications. 

Our expertise spans advanced image editing, static and moving picture synthesis, and precision-based 3D tracking systems for animation, virtual reality, robotics, and movement sciences.

Moreover, we emphasize efficiency in web, mobile, and desktop-based computer graphic real-time-rendering techniques.

Whether you're a researcher, student, industry professional, or digital technology admirer, come, join us. Let's create tools and technologies to redefine our interaction with the digital world. 

Reach out and let's explore together!
